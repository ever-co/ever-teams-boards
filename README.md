### Ever Teams sign-in

The Board lets in the people signed in to the Ever Teams deployment they came from (app.ever.team, demo.ever.team, ...).

1. Ever Teams opens the Board with `origin=<its origin>` in the address, for example `https://board.ever.team/?live=true&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo.ever.team`.
2. The Board uses that origin only when it is allowed: its parsed origin must equal one of the allowed origins exactly, over https (http is also accepted on localhost in development), without a user name or password. The Board remembers it in `localStorage`. A visit without an allowed `origin` uses the remembered origin when it is still allowed, else the origin of `VITE_APP_EVER_TEAMS_URL`.
3. The Board calls `GET <origin>/api/board/session` with `credentials: "include"`. Ever Teams answers from its own session cookies, so no token reaches the Board. This relies on the Board and Ever Teams being on the same site (subdomains of `ever.team`), so that the browser sends the Ever Teams cookies along.
   - `200` with `{ id, name, imageUrl }`: signed in.
   - `401`: not signed in. The Board shows "Access denied" with a Login link to `<origin>/auth/passcode?redirect=<Board address>`, which brings the person back to the Board once signed in.
   - Anything else (`404` from a deployment without this route, `403`, `503`, a network or CORS error): the Board falls back to the legacy check, the `auth-token` cookie (when the Board can read it) checked against `VITE_APP_GAUZY_API_URL`, and shows "Access denied" when that fails too.
4. The origin chosen for the visit is used everywhere else too. The links the Board creates (room links, scene links, the link in the share dialog) carry it as `origin`, so a collaborator who never opened the Board signs in on the same deployment, and any `origin` copied from the current address is replaced. The Ever Teams logo and the "Ever Teams" menu item lead back to it.

Build settings (`.env.production`, `.env.development`):

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_APP_EVER_TEAMS_URL` | Ever Teams deployment used when a visit names no allowed origin. Its origin is always allowed. |
| `VITE_APP_EVER_TEAMS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated Ever Teams origins allowed to open the Board, e.g. `https://app.ever.team,https://demo.ever.team,https://stage.ever.team`. Add a deployment here (and rebuild) before linking it to the Board. |
| `VITE_APP_GAUZY_API_URL` | API used by the legacy `auth-token` check only. |

On the Ever Teams side, each deployment sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOARD_APP_DOMAIN` to the exact Board origin (for example `https://board.ever.team`): only that origin may call `/api/board/session` or be used as the sign-in `redirect`.
